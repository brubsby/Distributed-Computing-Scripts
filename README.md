## Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search (GIMPS)

üÜï Thanks to Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/) (Colab) service, anyone with an internet connection can now contribute to GIMPS for üÜì, without downloading or installing anything! Please see our [google-colab](google-colab) directory for instructions.

### Prime95/MPrime

Downloads, sets up and runs [Prime95/MPrime](https://www.mersenne.org/download/#download). Supports only x86 CPUs.

```
wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mprime.sh | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

To run MPrime for Stress/Torture Testing, see the [Testing and Benchmarking](https://github.com/tdulcet/Testing-and-Benchmarking-Scripts) scripts.

### CUDALucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [CUDALucas](https://sourceforge.net/p/cudalucas/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python program](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments.

```
wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/cudalucas.sh | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### Mlucas

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download1). Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python program](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Supports x86 Intel and AMD and ARM CPUs, but only recommended for ARM CPUs, which [Prime95/MPrime](#prime95mprime) does not support. Prime95/MPrime is faster than Mlucas on x86 CPUs. Run: `wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Linux-System-Information/master/info.sh | bash -s` to output your system information, including CPU and architecture.
This script follows the recommended instructions on the [Mlucas README](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html) for each architecture and CPU.

```
wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/mlucas.sh | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### GpuOwl

Downloads, builds, sets up and runs the latest version of [GpuOwl](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl) for PRP tests, version 7.2-112 for PRP tests with combined P-1 and the [v6 branch](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl/tree/v6) for LL and standalone P-1 tests. Downloads, sets up and runs our [PrimeNet Python program](#primenet) for automated PrimeNet assignments. Creates wrapper script to run the correct version of GpuOwl based on the next assignment. Supports Nvidia, AMD and Intel GPUs supporting OpenCL. Note that [GpuOwl uses C++20](https://github.com/preda/gpuowl#build) and thus requires at least the GNU C++ compiler 8. Run: `g++ --version` to output your version.

```
wget -qO - https://raw.github.com/tdulcet/Distributed-Computing-Scripts/master/gpuowl.sh | bash -s -- [PrimeNet User ID] [Computer name] [Type of work] [Idle time to run (mins)]
```

### PrimeNet

Automatically gets assignments, reports assignment results, upload proof files and optionally registers assignments and reports assignment progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS programs. Supports both Python 2 and 3 and Windows, macOS and Linux. Requires the [Requests library](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), which is included with most Python 3 installations. The script will automatically install Requests on first run if it is not already installed. GIMPS [discontinued first time LL assignments](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?t=26682) in April 2021, although the script [still supports them](https://mersenneforum.org/showthread.php?p=575260#post575260) for users of CUDALucas or with limited disk space. Our [GpuOwl](#gpuowl), [CUDALucas](#cudalucas) and [Mlucas](#mlucas) Linux scripts automatically download, setup and run this. Adapted from the PrimeNet Python script from [Mlucas](https://www.mersenneforum.org/mayer/README.html#download2) by [Lo√Øc Le Loarer](https://github.com/llloic11/primenet) and Ernst W. Mayer, which itself was adapted from primetools by [Mark Rose](https://github.com/MarkRose/primetools) and [teknohog](https://github.com/teknohog/primetools).

#### Usage

```
Usage: primenet.py [options]

This program will automatically get assignments, report assignment results,
upload proof files and optionally register assignments and report assignment
progress to PrimeNet for the GpuOwl/PRPLL, CUDALucas and Mlucas GIMPS
programs. It also saves its configuration to a ‚Äúlocal.ini‚Äù file by default, so
it is only necessary to give most of the arguments once. The first time it is
run, if a password is NOT provided, it will register the current
GpuOwl/PRPLL/CUDALucas/Mlucas instance with PrimeNet (see the Registering
Options below). Then, it will report assignment results, get assignments and
upload any proof files to PrimeNet on the --timeout interval, or only once if
--timeout is 0. If registered, it will additionally report the progress on the
--checkin interval.

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit

  -D DIRS, --dir=DIRS   Directories relative to --workdir with the work and
                        results files from the GIMPS program. Provide once for
                        each worker. It automatically sets the --cpu-num
                        option for each directory.

                        GIMPS/PrimeNet User ID. Create a GIMPS/PrimeNet
                        account: https://www.mersenne.org/update/. If you do
                        not want a PrimeNet account, you can use ANONYMOUS.
  -p PASSWORD, --password=PASSWORD
                        Optional GIMPS/PrimeNet Password. Deprecated and not
                        recommended. Only provide if you want to do manual
                        testing and not report the progress. This was the
                        default behavior for old versions of this script.

                        to use the same worktype for all workers or once for
                        each worker to use different worktypes. Not all
                        worktypes are supported by all the GIMPS programs.
  --min-exp=MIN_EXP     Minimum exponent to get from PrimeNet (2 -
                        999,999,999)
  --max-exp=MAX_EXP     Maximum exponent to get from PrimeNet (2 -
                        999,999,999)
  -g, --gpuowl, --prpll
                        Get assignments for GpuOwl or PRPLL instead of Mlucas.
  --cudalucas=CUDALUCAS
                        Get assignments for CUDALucas instead of Mlucas.
                        Provide the CUDALucas output filename as the argument.
  --num-workers=NUM_WORKERS
                        Number of workers (CPU Cores/GPUs), Default: 1
  -c CPU, --cpu-num=CPU
                        CPU core or GPU number to get assignments for,
                        Default: 0. Deprecated in favor of the --dir option.
  -n NUM_CACHE, --num-cache=NUM_CACHE
                        Number of assignments to cache, Default: 0
                        (automatically incremented by 1 when doing manual
                        testing). Deprecated in favor of the --days-work
                        option.
  -W DAYS_OF_WORK, --days-work=DAYS_OF_WORK
                        Days of work to queue (1-180 days), Default: 3.0 days.
                        Adds one to num_cache when the time left for all
                        assignments is less than this number of days.
  --force-pminus1=TESTS_SAVED
                        Force P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests and/or change
                        the default PrimeNet PRP and P-1 tests_saved value.
  --pminus1-threshold=PM1_MULTIPLIER
                        Retry the P-1 factoring before LL/PRP tests only if
                        the existing P-1 bounds are less than the target
                        bounds (as listed on mersenne.ca) times this
                        threshold/multiplier. Requires the --force-pminus1
                        option.
  --force-pminus1-bounds=PM1_BOUNDS
                        Force using the 'MIN', 'MID' or 'MAX' optimal P-1
                        bounds (as listed on mersenne.ca) for P-1 tests. For
                        Mlucas, this will rewrite Pfactor= assignments to
                        Pminus1=. For GpuOwl, this will use a nonstandard
                        Pfactor= format to add the bounds. Can be used in
                        combination with the --force-pminus1 option.
  --convert-ll-to-prp   Convert all LL assignments to PRP. This is for use
                        when registering assignments.
  --convert-prp-to-ll   Convert all PRP assignments to LL. This is
                        automatically enabled for first time PRP assignments
                        when the --worktype option is for a first time LL
                        worktype.
  --no-report-100m      Do not report any prime results for exponents greater
                        than or equal to 100 million digits. You must setup
                        another method to notify yourself, such as setting the
                        notification options below.
  --checkin=HOURS_BETWEEN_CHECKINS
                        Hours to wait between sending assignment progress and
                        expected completion dates (1-168 hours), Default: 6
                        hours. Requires that the instance is registered with
                        PrimeNet.
  -t TIMEOUT, --timeout=TIMEOUT
                        Seconds to wait between updates, Default: 3600 seconds
                        (1 hour). Users with slower internet may want to set a
                        larger value to give time for any PRP proof files to
                        upload. Use 0 to update once and exit.
  -s, --status          Output a status report and any expected completion
                        dates for all assignments and exit.
  --upload-proofs       Report assignment results, upload all PRP proofs and
                        exit. Requires PrimeNet User ID.
  --recover-all         Recover all assignments and exit. This will overwrite
                        any existing work files. Requires that the instance is
                        registered with PrimeNet.
  --register-exponents  Prompt for all parameters needed to register one or
                        more specific exponents and exit.
  --unreserve=EXPONENT  Unreserve the exponent and exit. Use this only if you
                        are sure you will not be finishing this exponent.
                        Requires that the instance is registered with
                        PrimeNet.
  --unreserve-all       Unreserve all assignments and exit. Quit GIMPS
                        immediately. Requires that the instance is registered
                        with PrimeNet.
  --no-more-work        Prevent this program from getting new assignments and
                        exit. Quit GIMPS after current work completes.
  --ping                Ping the PrimeNet server, show version information and
                        exit.
  --setup               Prompt for all the options that are needed to setup
                        this program and exit.

  Registering Options:
    Sent to PrimeNet/GIMPS when registering. It will automatically send
    the progress, which allows the program to then be monitored on the
    GIMPS website CPUs page (https://www.mersenne.org/cpus/), just like
    with Prime95/MPrime. This also allows the program to get much smaller
    Category 0 and 1 exponents, if it meets the other requirements
    (https://www.mersenne.org/thresholds/).

                        for P-1 assignments.
    --max-disk-space=WORKER_DISK_SPACE
                        Configured disk space limit per worker to store the
                        proof interim residues files for PRP tests
                        (GiB/worker), Default: 0.0 GiB/worker. Use 0 to not
                        send.
    --l1=CPU_L1_CACHE_SIZE
                        L1 Data Cache size (KiB), Default: 8 KiB

                        more for hyperthreaded.
    --hours=CPU_HOURS   Hours per day you expect the GIMPS program will run (1
                        - 24), Default: 24 hours. Used to give better
                        estimated completion dates.

  Notification Options:
    Optionally configure this program to automatically send an e-mail/text
    message notification if there is an error, if the GIMPS program has
    stalled, if the available disk space is low or if it found a new
    Mersenne prime. Send text messages by using your mobile providers
    e-mail to SMS or MMS gateway. Use the --test-email option to verify
    the configuration.

    --to=TOEMAILS       To e-mail address. Use multiple times for multiple
                        To/recipient e-mail addresses. Defaults to the --from

Thanks to [Daniel Connelly](https://github.com/Danc2050) for updating the PrimeNet Python script from Mlucas to eliminate the password requirement by getting assignments using the [PrimeNet API](http://v5.mersenne.org/v5design/v5webAPI_0.97.html) and to support reporting the assignment results and progress for CUDALucas using the PrimeNet API, for porting the MPrime script to Python and for helping create and test the Google Colab Jupyter Notebooks!

Thanks to Ernst W. Mayer for helping test and for providing feedback on the Mlucas install script.

Thanks to Isaac Terrell for providing the needed PRP proof files to test the proof file uploading feature.
